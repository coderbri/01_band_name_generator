# 01 Band Name Generator

This is the **Day 1 Challenge** from Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp. The project aims to apply basic Python concepts, including printing to the console, string manipulation, input handling, and variable naming.

## Project Description

The Band Name Generator is a fun and interactive program that helps users generate a potential band name by combining the name of the city they grew up in and their pet's name. It's a great way to practice:

- Printing to the console in Python.
- Using the `input()` function for user interaction.
- String manipulation for combining inputs.
- Variable assignment and naming conventions.


## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the `band_name_generator.py` file.
2. Run the script with Python 3:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
